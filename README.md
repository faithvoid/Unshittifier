# Unshittifier
Unshittifier - A Firefox extension that blocks social media websites subject to enshittification (ie; Meta, X, TikTok) and redirects the user to un-enshittified equivalents. Don't put up with user-hostile websites or give them your ad revenue!

# Current Redirects
Twitter -> Bluesky

Facebook -> Mastodon

Instagram + TikTok -> PixelFed

Meta -> (Blocked)

# Why?
I'm tired of these user-hostile social media platforms that are unusable being commonplace. All major social media platforms are essentially just bots and ragebait, and life's too short to be subjected to that sort of nonsense. Social media should be about connecting with people first and foremost, not generating capital by making your websites functionally worse to extract every last dollar.

# TODO:
- Add more redirects
- Add a per-site toggle
- Allow users to set manual redirects for each website
- Add cute random animal photos to the blocked page to lighten the user's mood.
