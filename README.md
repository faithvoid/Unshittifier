# Unshittifier
Unshittifier - A Firefox extension that blocks social media websites subject to enshittification (ie; Meta, X, TikTok) and redirects the user to un-enshittified equivalents. Don't put up with user-hostile websites or give them your ad revenue!

# TODO:
- Redirect enshittified websites to non-enshittified equivalents (ie; X to BlueSky, Instagram to Pixelfed, etc.)
