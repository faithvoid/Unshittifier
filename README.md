# unshittifier
A Firefox extension that blocks social media websites subject to enshittification (ie; Meta, X, TikTok) and redirects the user to unshittified equivalents. Don't put up with user-hostile websites or give them your ad revenue!

# Current Redirects
## Full (redirects to an unshittified version of the exact link you've selected)
- Youtube -> Invidious (invidious.nerdvpn.de)
- Twitter -> XCancel (toggle)
- Reddit -> RedLib (redlib.r4fo.com)

## Basic (only redirects to an unshittified equivalent of the website in question)
- Twitter -> Bluesky (toggle)

- Facebook -> Mastodon

- Instagram + TikTok -> PixelFed

## Blocked (explains itself)
- Meta

# Why?
I'm tired of these user-hostile social media platforms that are unusable being commonplace. All major social media platforms are essentially just bots and ragebait, and life's too short to be subjected to that sort of nonsense. Social media should be about connecting with people first and foremost, not generating capital by making your websites functionally worse to extract every last dollar.

# TODO:
- Add more redirects
- Add a per-site toggle
- Use European servers as opposed to American servers as enhanced user privacy measure
- Add XCancel redirect option for X for those willing to put up with X-induced psychic damage
- Redirect queries / URLs to their unshittified equivalents (ie; YouTube bookmarks will automatically redirect to yewtu.be)
- Allow users to set manual redirects for each website
- Add cute random animal photos to the blocked page to lighten the user's mood.
